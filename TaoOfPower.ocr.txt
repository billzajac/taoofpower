In this translation, I have. whenever possible, followed the

original Chinese text word for word, without adding rhyme or

in the book along with each translated passage so that those
readers interested in this unusual and rather beautiful written
language should be able to find their way through the Chinese

script, even without prior knowledge of the characters.

THE

TAO

NO ONE ACTUALLY KNOWS where the Tao Te Ching came from, but this slim
book of about five thousand words forms the foundation of classical Chinese
philosophy. Simply stated, the book explains an evolving force called Tao that
operates throughout the universe; and it describes the personal power that comes
being in step with the Tao, which is known as Te. The word Ching means
"c assic."
Throughout the twenty-five-hundred-year history of the Tao Te Ching, hundreds of translations and commentaries have been published
more than fifty
in English alone
making it, next to the Bible, the world's most-translated
classic. The book has found an audience in each new generation and never
seems to lose its provocative intellectual value. In this decade, the Tao Te Ching
has been rediscovered by physicists, who find in it remarkable correlations with
their theories of the universe. The Tao Te Ching, moreover, is being explored

fr<1>m

—

by psychologists and business leaders who hope to understand that quality of
the oriental mind that makes it so centered and insightful in world affairs and
economics. The book casts a spell over those who contemplate it; it is a magnet
for minds with the potential to influence society. Indeed, influencing society is
what the Tao Te Ching is all about.
According to legend, the book was written by Lao Tzu, a gifted scholar
who lived nearly twenty-six centuries ago and worked as the Custodian of the
Imperial Archives during the reign of the Chou Dynasty. Lao Tzu experienced a
time of political unrest not unlike our own. His world was divided into
hundreds of separate provinces, each with its own laws and leaders. He saw a
buildup of arms and hostilities as each province competed for political
supremacy. Every aggressive act was met with further hostility and aggression,
until it seemed to the war-tom people of China that they stood on the threshold
of complete destruction and that their world would finish as a wasteland

10

Sensing the hopelessness of the era, with its hostile political counterreactions spiraling out of control, Lao Tzu retired from his position and prepared
to leave the civilized world forever. Before he was allowed to pass through the
gates of the capital into the mountains beyond, Yin Hsi, Keeper of the Gate,
insisted that Lao Tzu write down what he knew for the enlightenment of those
left behind. Lao Tzu crafted the Tao Te Ching, directing it toward those
toward princes and
individuals who were in a position to guide others
and
educators.
politicians, employers
What Lao Tzu tells leaders is essentially this: Discover who you are. Learn
to sense the world around you directly, and contemplate your impressions
deeply. Do not rely on ideologies, because to do so will rob your life of
meaning and make you unfit to lead. Cultivate and make trustworthy your
intuition, because a leader who is not intuitive cannot predict change. Build up
your personal power (Te) though your awareness and knowledge of the
physical laws as they operate both in the universe and in the minds of others
then use that power to direct events, without resorting to force. How
(Tao)
is this done? Use attitude instead of action, and lead others by guiding rather
than ruling. Manage people by letting them act on you, and not the other way
around. In this way, your subjects will develop a sense of self-govemment, and
you, as their guide, will be rewarded with their loyalty and cooperation. Learn
to achieve your ends without means, by cultivating a strong vision of the way
things must naturally resolve themselves. Practice Simplicity. Continue to grow.
Lao Tzu believed that the ideal way to direct events was to use methods that
do not create resistance or elicit counter-reactions. In observing the laws of
nature, he realized that excessive force in a particular direction tends to trigger
the growth of an opposing force, and that therefore the use of force cannot be
the basis for establishing a strong and lasting social foundation. Lao Tzu
believed that it was essential for leaders to be ever observant of the laws of
in short, to develop a sophisticated understanding of the ways that
nature
matter and energy function in the universe. He called this Tao. He realized that
the physical laws of the universe directly affect the ways that individuals tend to
behave and societies tend to evolve, and that to comprehend these laws could
give a leader the power (Te) to bring harmony to the world.
The Tao Te Ching is a challenge. It challenges us to see the world as it
actually is by accepting the stark truth of the physical laws that control existence
a state
and evolution. It challenges us to discover intellectual independence
of mind in which we have complete trust in our own perceptions of the world
and can rely fully on the appropriateness of our own inspirations and instincts.
It challenges us to find the courage to reject force, and instead, to influence
others through Our example, using nature as our pattern
balancing the extremes in the world instead of causing them. This final challenge is perhaps
more vital today than ever before, both for ourselves and for our leaders. Lao
Tzu put it this way:
—

—

—

—

—

Evolved Individuals hold to the Tao,
And regard the world as their Pattern.

They do not display themselves;
Therefore they are illuminated.
They do not define themselves;
Therefore they are distinguished.
They do not make claims;
Therefore they are credited.
They do not boast;
Therefore they advance.

THE

TAO

OF

POWER

THE TAO TE CHING EXPLORES A REMARKABLE POWER that is latent in every
individual. This power, which Lao Tzu calls Te, emerges when one is aware of
and aligned with the forces in nature (Tao). It is essential to Lao Tzu's system

that we understand why and how reality functions, and that we come to realize
that nature invariably takes its course. We already know that it is rarely worth
the effort to swim upstream, but do we know which way the stream is flowing?
We realize that it is difficult and unsatisfying to cut across the grain, but can we
see which way the grain runs? Lao Tzu believed that a constant awareness of
the patterns in nature will bring us insights into the parallel patterns in human
behavior: Just as spring follows winter in nature, growth follows repression in
society; just as too much gravity will collapse a star, too much possessiveness
will collapse an idea.
Like all matter and energy in the universe, the emotional and intellectual
structures that we build are constantly transformed by outside forces. Much of
our power is wasted in
propping up our beliefs, defending them, and conothers
to
in
believe
them so that they might become "permanent." Once
vincing
we understand the folly in this, we gain power by
using the evolution in nature
to our advantage
and
accepting, incorporating,
supporting change when and
where it wants to occur. Our cooperation with the forces in nature makes us a
part of those forces. Our decisions become astute because they are based on a
dynamic, evolving reality, not on fixed or wishful thinking. We are able to see
things that others might not because the reach of our minds is extended through
the contemplation of the universe. We develop vision and we help create the
future with the power of our vision.
Lao Tzu believed that when people do not have a sense of power they
become resentful and uncooperative. Individuals who do not feel personal
power feel fear. They fear the unknown because they do not identify with the
world outside of themselves; thus their psychic integration is severely damaged
and they are a danger to their society. Tyrants do not feel power, they feel
frustration and impotency. They wield force, but it is a form of aggression, not
authority. On closer inspection, it becomes apparent that individuals who
dominate others are, in fact, enslaved by insecurity and are slowly and mysteriously hurt by their own actions. Lao Tzu attributed most of the world's ills to
the fact that people do not feel powerful and independent.

Powerful individuals never show their strength, yet others listen to them
because they seem to know. They radiate knowledge, but it is an intuitive
knowing that comes from a direct understanding and experience with the ways
of nature. They are compassionate and generous because they instinctively
realize that power continues to flow through them only when they pass it on.
Like electricity, the more energy, inspiration, and information they conduct, the
more they receive.
True power is the ability to influence and change the world while living a
simple, intelligent, and experientially rich existence. Powerful individuals
influence others with the force of example and attitude. Within
groups, they
have great presence
intellectual gravity
that influences the minds of those
exposed to them. Intellectual gravity deve10ps as a result of expanded identification
an identification that reaches far outside the self. Individuals who
can identify with the evolution of reality develop significance and power because
the force of their awareness is actively defining the universe around them.
There are two major changes that occur in the lives of individuals who
achieve personal power: the rise of intellectual independence and the need for
simplicity. Taoism, as a way of understanding the universe, is not based on
faith; it is based on experience. The human mind is evolving, while all social
systems are temporary experiments. Relying on systems of understanding
created or interpreted by others will dull the instincts and prevent individuals
from cultivating and expanding their own minds. Power will not develop in
individuals who allow doctrine and dogma to stand between them and direct
personal knowledge of the universe.
Simplicity in conduct, in beliefs, and in environment brings an individual
very close to the truth of reality. Individuals who practice simplicity cannot be
used because they already have everything they need; they cannot be lied to
because a lie merely reveals to them another aspect of reality. An attraction to
the highest expression of
simplicity is essentially an attraction to freedom
personal power. We are taught to think of freedom as something one has, but it
is really the absence of things that brings freedom to the individual and meaning
into life. To let go of things
unnecessary desires, superfluous possessions
is to have them. Lao Tzu believed that an individual life contains the whole
universe, but when individuals develop fixations about certain parts of life they
become narrow and shallow and uncentered. Fixations and desires create a
crisis within the mind. As individuals let go of desires, feelings of freedom,
security, independence, and power increase accordingly.

universe) and a breakthrough in personal goals (because our desires become
rooted in simplicity and we are freed of emotional delusion). Those who find a
resonant voice in Lao Tzu are destined to transcend the commonplace and to use
the power that comes from their personal freedom to shape the fixture.
The Tao Te Ching is written on many levels. There is a level waiting just
below the one you currently understand. The deeper you penetrate, the more
power you develop. The more potential you have for influence in the world, the
stronger and more penetrating your insights become. The philosophy that Lao

THE

TAO

OF

NATURE

LAO TZU WAS PERHAPS THE WORLD'S FIRST theoretical physicist. He devoted
all of his intellectual energy to observing nature and its physical laws and to
noting the interdependent relationship of all things. He saw a unified field of
forces that he called Tao, but because what he saw could not be expressedm a

logical, analytical fashion, he conveyed it through paradox. The eighty-one
chaptersin his small book are riddled with self-contradictory phrases. "The Tao
illuminated appears to be obscure. The Tao advancing appears to be retreating.
It is the form of the formless; the
image of nothingness." Lao Tzu used paradox
to provoke an unusual awareness in hrs readers, and to help explain the patterns
and cycles, the parity and complementarity, that he saw superimposed on reality
by the physical forces in the universe. The most striking of these patterns,
central to the Tao Te Ching, is that of polarity.
Polarity arises from the Taoist view of the cosmological origins of the

an Absolute. The Chinese call
universe: Before existence there was an idea
it T'ar' Chi, the Supreme Ultimate. The Absolute, in a sudden and tremendous
desire to know itself, divided itself from nonexistence in a cataclysmic event
an event that
resulting in endless cause and effect
neatly parallels the
so-called Big Bang Theory. Instantly, space was formed and time began, and
—

—

charged states came into being, yin (negative) and yang (positive). As a
result of the complementary polarity of yin and yang, matter and energy, which
were at first undifferentiated, separated and regrouped into the physical reality
that became our universe.
Lao Tzu believed that everything that exists comes into reality through the
polarity of yin and yang. He called the specific physical laws and cycles that
control and govern reality the Tao, and suggested that the actions of the Tao
reflect the purpose of a larger entity (the Absolute). So if reality came about
two

14

because the Absolute wanted to know itself, then our evolutionary destiny must
be to help it get a good look by investigating, observing, and emulating nature.
In the Taoist view, developing an awareness of the laws of nature, especially as they manifest themselves in human culture, is a major component of
personal grth and evolution. Lao Tzu believed that people and their attitudes
and actions are inseparable from the physical phenomena surrounding them; and
that either might alter the reality of the other.
Since the advent of quantum mechanics (the mathematics that describes the
interactions that take place at the sub-atomic level), scientists have become
intrigued with the link between human awareness and the workings of the
universe. Quantum mechanics seems to suggest that the sub-atomic world
and even the world beyond the atom
has no independent structure at all until

Heisenberg, who transformed physics

when he developed this concept in 1927, notes: "Natural science does not
simply describe and explain nature; it is a part of the interplay between nature
and ourselves... What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to
our method of questioning." A new generation of physicists are now postulating
that a universe cannot even come into existence unless it contains the possibility
of life. They suggest that we live in a participatory universe where all reality
and physical laws are dependent upon an observer to formulate them. Lao Tzu
would clearly concur.
Conceiving of a universe where reality is shaped through the force of the
intellect (and vice versa) may be somewhat easier for physicists than it is for the
rest of us, but it is a concept that is indispensable to anyone seeking powerful
whether at the atomic
insights into the ways of the world. All investigations
level or at the level of our own cultural behavior
yield more refined and
accurate information when approached from this paradoxical point of view.
Fortunately, the structure of the brain and the bilateral processes of the mind can
make effective use of this form of thought.
The brain accepts all types of information from all stimuli simultaneously,
and the mind processes it in the form of emotional responses, intuitive feelings,
and logically formulated analyses. In the West, we rely almost exclusively on
logical analysis. We are encouraged to think in a linear fashion, using words
and numbers to draw conclusions about our work and our lives. These logical
functions, according to neurological research, are performed by the left hemiSphere of the brain. At the same time, we learn to discount aesthetic or intuitive
a right-hemisphere function
because it is considered less
information
valuable to our culture. Thus we find ourselves primarily concerned with measuring events and analyzing their meaning, rather than creating and directing
their flow. We are taught to ignore the intuitive or irrational, no matter how
strong these "gut feelings" might be. As these right-hemisphere feelings are
repressed, we lose touch with our intuitive mind and our insights become

increasingly rare.

Lao Tzu believed that intuitive knowledge was the purest form of information. For that reason, he expressed his philosophy in the form of thought

skills. In the Tao Te Ching, he compels us to use intuition as an equal partner
with logic, and encourages us to combine our cognitive understanding of the
world around us with a strong personal vision. Neurologically, we might call

this a "whole-mind" approach, wherein the spatially and aesthetically astute right

THE

RIGHT MIND APPROACH

MANY OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL CLASSICS OF CHINA are written in a style for
which there is no counterpart in Western literature. The majority of Western
philosophy seems to emerge from the analytical left hemisphere of the brain,
wherein a hypothesis is logically developed through a number of chapters until a
conclusion is reached at the end of the book. Chinese classics, by contrast, seem
to emerge from the spatially oriented right hemisphere of the brain. These works
are, in a sense, holographic: each chapter is complete and each reflects the entire
book. The only difference between chapters is a very slight shift in the angle of
the view of the central premise. Thus, when exploring a classic like the Tao Te
it may be appropriate to match its nonlinear style by reading the book at

Perhaps they
open the book at random in order to select the next passage to
contemplate. Using chance and synchronicity in their approach they can then
contemplate, too, why that particular passage appeared in their lives at that particular moment.
In nature, a snowflake is a snowflake
until we take a closer look and see
that no two snowflakes are formed in the same way. So too, in human nature,
no two individuals are informed in the same way. Those who would like to
allow nature to determine their intellectual path through the Tao Te Ching may
find that a random approach to the text will help nigger the spirit of the moment
and open their mind to self-discovery. Readers who are familiar with Chinese
philosophy will recognize the approach that follows, since similar forms of
subjective interaction are used in such classics as the T'ai Hsuan Ching, a
philosophical work from the early history of China (c.1 B.C.), and the I Ching.
In the I Ching, each of the sixty-four passages is represented by a hexagram, a mathematical diagram constructed from six stacked lines of two types
(solid and broken). There are sixty-four possible arrangements of these two
types of lines (26). Through the use of the hexagrams, the Chinese developed
—

the binary numbering system nearly three millennia before it reached the rest of
the world. Their binary system was based on the the square of 8, thus sixty-four
became an important number in Chinese philosophy.
It is no accident that the Tao Te Ching has eighty-one chapters, for eighty-

HEXAGRAM

one, the square of 9, is also a significant number to those Chinese philosophers
who treasured the symmetry of numbers. The elegance of the number eightyone was expressed by the ancient Chinese with the use of mathematical diagrams known as tetragrams. A tetragram is constructed from four stacked lines
of three types (solid, broken, and twice-broken There are eighty-one possible
arrangements of these three types of lines (3 ). The tetragrams, which were
once used to randomly explore the Ta Hsuan Ching, are combined here with
the eighty-one passages of the Tao Te Ching. They appear in the Tetragram
Arrangement on the next page.
There are two ways to use the tetragrams to select one of the passages in the
Tao Te Ching. The first method is quick and requires the use of a six-sided

To use the stick counting method, you will need to find sixty-four long (6 to
inches) thin sticks. Once you gather your sticks, you will need a surface to
work on and a pencil and paper.

1. Separate the sticks at random into three bundles in front of you.
2. Pick up the bundle on the far right and count it out by threes. There will
be either 0, 1, or 2 sticks remaining. Put the remainder to one side. If the remainder is 0, take one stick from the bundle you just counted and
put that aside instead.
3. Repeat step 2 for the middle bundle, then add the remainder to the remainder from the fust bundle.
4. Repeat step 2 for the final bundle and add the remainder to the remainder
of the first two bundles.
5. Total the number of sticks in the remainder pile. There will be 3, 4, or 5.
This number represents the bottom line of your tetragram. Refer to the diagram
below and draw the corresponding line.
6. Gather all the sticks and repeat this entire process three more times,
beginning with step 1, until you have built, from the bottom up, a tetragram.

To determine the number of your tetragram, refer to the Bigram Chart on the
page. Since the tetragram is constructed from the bottom up, the two lower
lines are called the lower bigram, and the two upper lines are called the upper
bigram. Divide your tetragram into bigrams, then look down the right hand
column and locate your lower bigram. Now, trace horizontally across that
column until you are directly under your upper bigram. The number you will
find there corresponds to the number of one of the passages in the Tao Te
Ching. This, then, is the passage you will read next, for it is- the next step in
your journey through The Tao of Power. You may wish to use some of the
Journal pages in the book to keep track of the sequence of your travels.

THE

LEFT MIND APPROACH

THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE OF THE BRAIN attempts to understand what it experiences through overall intuitive impressions. It tries to
encompass, in its impressions, all of the changing details of an event, even though it cannot analyze the

actually fit together to form a whole. This hemisphere is more ingaining a broad understanding than it is in examining the details. It
takes a top-down approach from an orbiting perspective.
The left hemisphere, by comparison, understands what it experiences by
measuring, analyzing, and categorizing each detail of an event. It learns about
the forest by examining each tree; and over time it builds, from the bottom up,
an understanding. For this reason, the left
hemisphere lends itself to a more
formal exploration of the Tao Te Ching than does the right hemisphere.
way they
volved in

Because each passage in the book describes a different intellectual or behavioral interaction with the Tao, each passage explores a specific aspect of
potential power (Te). To explore these power topics in detail, the eighty-one
passages of the Tao Te Ching can be divided into six separate sections. The
interpretations in any of the six sections, when read contiguously, examine a
specific theme throughout that section. Therefore, six distinct approaches to
power will be investigated in this arrangement of the passages. The Guide to the
Passages, on the next page, will help you locate the power area that you would
like to

investigate. They are:

POWER IN NATURE: Each of these passages focuses

on

the very basic

physical laws that describe Taoist philosophy. This section deals with the cosmology of the Tao and the origins of the universe and is best understood by
using a scientific point of view.
POWER IN AWARENESS: These passages further explore the physical
laws operating in nature as well as the basic philosophical assumptions in
Taoism. The information in this section is presented in the form of thought experiments: awareness exercises that can be used to expand the mind and cultivate
the powers of intuition.

POWER IN PROJECTION:

These passages comprise another set of
thought or idea experiments. In this section, however, the exercises are designed to help individuals use attitude and conduct in order to cultivate personal
power and gain influence within their environment.

POWER IN LEADERSHIP: The passages in this section are aimed directly at those who are in positions of leadership. Each passage describes the ideal
relationship between leaders and their subjects, revealing the most effective
methods for managing others and accomplishing aims.
POWER IN ORGANIZATIONS: This section examines the behavior of
individuals engaged in group endeavors, as well as the conduct of organizations
involved in worldly endeavors. These passages describe those Taoist principles
that lead to the harmonious achievement of group objectives.
POWER IN NONINTERFERENCE: Although the principle of tactical
noninterfercnce (Lao Tzu calls it wu wei, or nonaction) is touched upon in many
of the passages in the Tao Te Citing, the passages selected for this section explore in detail the use of "hands-off" techniques for achieving lasting influence
in worldly endeavors.

THE

WHOLE MIND APPROACH

WHEN INDIVIDUALS USE THEIR WHOLE MIND to understand and interact with
the world around them, they are, in a sense, using two distinct minds. Their
worldly mind allows them to formulate logical reactions to the physical reality
in their environment, while their universal mind collects and responds to impressions of both physical and nonphysical reality. The fact is, all of us experience reality and accumulate information with both minds simultaneously, but
not all of us take full advantage of this expanded awareness.
The worldly mind focuses on the plane of physical reality. Physical
reality
is a body of information that is experienced through the physical senses:
sight,
sound, and touch. This information is processed by the mind in a contained,
analytical fashion, using primarily the language of words and numbers to
achieve the stability of logic. Some individuals live their entire lives and base all
of their experiences on information found on this plane, but it is really a world
more suited to machines than
people.
The universal mind works on the plane of physical reality but focuses, also,
on nonphysical reality. Nonphysical
reality is a body of information that is
with
a
second
set
of
senses
that includes instinct and intuition. This
experienced
information is processed by the mind in a universal, open-ended fashion, using
the language of pattern to achieve the advantage of insight.
The goal of Taoist philosophy is to combine these two minds into a working
perspective. This is clearly a timely contribution to the West, where we are
predisposed to information that comes solely from the physical plane. Indeed,
the physical plane can be touched, heard, and seen
and therefore, it is real.
When we act on it, it changes; and this is immediately gratifying and, certainly,
intellectually safe. But herein lies a principal paradox in Taoist philosophy.
If individuals do all of their thinking on the physical plane and make little
effort on the nonphysical plane
cultivating intuition, gaining instinctive
knowledge of the workings of the universe, and developing the insight to evolve
both themselves and their society
then those lives have no real meaning or
in
terms
of
significance
physical reality. This is so because work done on the
is
more
nonphysical plane
aligned with the purpose of the universe and,
therefore, it has a more powerful effect upon our physical reality. Our inner
work influences and evolves the universe, which in turn, evolves our reality.
So the deeper we work, the more striking the changes on the physical plane and
the more rapid the evolution of the species as a whole. By comparison, our
efforts on the physical surface of this remote piece of earth stranded in the
farthest edge of the universe are not only insignificant, but hopelessly entangled
in cause and effect, in action and reaction.

If we extend the Taoist ideal of a cooperative world-consciousness to universal dimensions, then the universe has but one purpose and evolution moves
in one direction: toward the development of a vast network of a nervous system
that will bring into existence a conscious mind for the entire universe. We, as
individuals, and even as a world society, are then merely neurons in the growth
of what,

at

the moment, is

a

very

primitive,

universal brain. We

can see

the

embedded pattern of this growth reflected, for example, in the evolution of our
from the simplest brain stem of the lower life forms to the complex
species
brain-mind of humans; and we can see it in the evolution of our thinking tools
from the primitive computer that can calculate numbers to the interconnected
network of an informed and discerning data structure.
The fact is, each of us knows far more about reality
past, present, and
future
than we are able to understand and express rationally. And, whether
—

—

—

—-—

work on our inner development, we all experience, with our intuitive
the
most profound truths about our world and our destiny. What we
minds,
must do, then, is use our analytical, logical mind to bring this potentially vital
information to the surface, where we can use it.
Throughout the book you will find Journal pages that can be useful in stimulating your insights into reality. To use them, you would record an experience
in life, and then look for a pattern in that experience that correlates to larger
physical patterns in the universe. The idea, here, is to translate your experiences
all the way from the subjective and worldly to the objective and universal. All
experiences in life, when intellectually evolved in this way, become "largerthan-personal" experiences and take on deeper meaning. Patterns emerge; periodically they repeat themselves. The act of describing your life in universal
terms trains the mind to recognize these patterns, and by recognizing the natural
cycle of events, you will begin to apprehend the future.
To use the Journal, select a lined page from the book and use it to describe
or not we

event, transaction, relationship, or revelation that seems to stand out on your
path through life. Then pull your mind back from the details of the situation you
just described and attempt to describe it again, using a metaphor from nature.
For example, a dead-end position that forced you to change careers might find
an analogy in a river pouring into a box canyon and eventually overflowing to
form a new waterway. Or the difficulty encountered in launching a complex
idea, which later becomes a popular product, might be described as the energy
spent overcoming the inertia of a heavy object, and the subsequent momentum
that propels it on. When a relationship is pulled apart by outside influences, we
might compare it to a planet with limited mass whose satellite spins out of orbit.
Or perhaps it is a heavy atom whose weakening nucleus jettisons an electron
an

requiring a stronger charge.

When we record and retranslate our personal experiences in the language of
nature, we are developing a dialogue with the universe. We begin to reidentify
ourselves in the world, using our growing awareness of the cycles in nature:
difficult and easy, blocked and open, positive and negative. Through our awareness of the physical laws as they are reflected in our lives, we form a direct and
interdependent relationship with an elegant, impartial, and evolving universe.
When we align our lives to the rhythms of this universe, we begin to understand
its purpose and we begin to reflect its significance in our own lives.
The power and astuteness that we gain from this universal perspective can
be applied to any of life's situations. We learn how people tend to behave and
societies tend to evolve, and we recognize situations that hold no promise because they are structured in a way that will cause their own downfall. Thus we
develop the power to direct our lives into a future that we, in fact, participate in
creating. And, in doing so, we achieve the fulfillment that comes from leaving
what we touch with our minds a little more evolved than we found it.

ABSOLUTE
The character for absolute or eternal ( f; ) consists of a roof ( "L’ ), which divides
wind and rain ( , ), and has come to mean that which is superior. Under the roof
is a window ( a ) from which apiece of cloth ( I") ) is suspended ( l ). The
image
of the hanging cloth represents a flag or banner that flies constantly.
\

THE BEGINNING OF POWER
The Tao that can be expressed
Is not the Tao of the Absolute.
The name that can be named
Is not the name of the Absolute.

The nameless originated Heaven and Earth.
The named is the Mother of All Things.

Thus, without expectation,
One will always perceive the subtlety;
And, with expectation,
One will always perceive the boundary.
The source of these two is identical,
Yet their names are different.
Together they are called profound,
Profound and mysterious,
The gateway to the Collective Subtlety.

Lao Tzu is

at his most mysterious and obscure in this passage and, although it embodies many of the major elements of the philosophy of the Tao Te Ching, these
elements are presented in more depth in other passages. Briefly, in the Taoist cosmology, the Absolute (the nameless) created a universe composed of matter and
energy. The Tao (the named) is the behavior of the physical laws that coalesce matter and energy into All Things in the universe and direct their evolution.
In this passage and throughout the book, Lao Tzu urges his readers to drop their
expectations, to discard their preconceived ideas, to abandon any method of
knowing that might limit their horizons. When expectations are dropped, the mind
expands, and reality expands along with the mind. Rather than merely perceiving
where things are and where they have been (the boundary), an individual can begin
to perceive the direction in which things are going (the subtlety). There is obvious
power in apprehending the probabilities of the future, but moreover, a subtler power
one that brings insight and centeredness. Individuals begin to sense

In this way

Existence and nonexistence produce each other.
Difficult and easy complete each other.
Long and short contrast each other.
High and low attract each other.
Pitch and tone harmonize each other.
Future and past follow each other.

Therefore, Evolved Individuals
Hold their position without effort,
Practice their philosophy without words,
Are a part of All Things and overlook nothing.
They produce but do not possess,
Act without expectation,
Succeed without taking credit.

Since, indeed, they take no credit, it remains with them.
The underlying principle in Taoist philosophy

just as in the physical sciences
is that of complementarity or polarity. Every action has its complementary reaction,
and every pole is matched by one of opposite charge. The intellectual goal of the
Taoist, then, is to find a correlation between the way matter and energy behave in
nature and the ways that humans conduct themselves in societies.
Evolved Individuals use their awareness and understanding of the physical laws
to shape events in their world. They know that
nothing exists without the presence
of its opposite; therefore they control their environment by avoiding extremes, even
in a direction that might be considered "good." They do not preach their philosophy. They overlook nothing in their environment, and yet they do not try to possess things, not even their own ideas and work.
They do not shoulder the burden of
great expectations, and especially do not take credit for their achievements. As a
result, nature and society are forced to balance toward them by bestowing credit on
them.

head of a leader( fi‘ ). It is combined with the marks offeet running ( 3 ) and

It identifies with the ways of the world.

This Image in front of the source.

in this passage, the Tao is not the source of the universe
rather
it is the way that everything in the universe changes and

The concept of "Heaven and Earth" refers

in nature, Evolved Individuals do so as well. They know they must regard humankind impartially if they are to gain perspective about themselves and their own
position in the world. Evolved Individuals, nevertheless, are compassionate in their
emotional and intellectual independence. Because they are centered, they spontaneously react with benevolence. To hold to the center is to listen to the voice of the

an extension of the mind of the universe. To follow one is to be in
harmony with the other. This is the path to self-discovery.

The term impartial can be literally translated as "not humane." The
word humane is etymologically derived from two characters, "man"
and "two" (signifying a group), and refers to people in
identification with their society.
The term straw dogs comes from an ancient Chinese custom
wherein animals were fashioned in straw to be burned in sacrificial
rites. There was no emotional attachment to these images; they
simply performed a cultural function.

The first of China's legendary emperors, Fu Hsi is believed to have lived between
2953 and 2838 RC. He is credited with the invention of the calendar and the
marriage contract, and was the creator of the stringed musical instrument. He also
taught his people to hunt, fish, and cook, as well as to raise animals domestically.

natural change occurs without force or resistance and it therefore endures. Thus,
careful positioning is the strategy of Evolved Individuals. By putting themselves last

environment to counterbalance and bring them forward naturally.
Although it is true that in acting without self-interest, one's interests will be
fulfilled, individuals who put self-interest last discover that their desires are transformed. As their awareness expands, they develop priorities that are aligned intel—
ligently with both the current situation and with larger influences in the world. For
this reason, as their aims are fulfilled, their environment evolves.

counter to the common view that one must contend and struggle to achieve success.
The values mentioned in this passage are values that can be attained only with a
fully expanded perspective: To achieve location one must know the whole; to
achieve depth one must realize its possibility; to achieve benevolence one must comprehend human nature; to achieve sincerity one must know inner truth; to achieve
order one must know the entire structure; to achieve competence one must know the
results of a perfectly executed task; to achieve timeliness one must hold in mind both
the past and future. With such a breadth of awareness, contention is unnecessary,
for the instincts and intuition that develop as a result lead unfailingly to fulfillment.

of absence that the natural forces are compelled to resolve. This intellectual integration with the laws of nature allows Evolved Individuals to position themselves

Strong desires that are dependent on outside events or on the whims and judgments
of others will lead individuals away from the cultivation of personal power. Lao Tzu
suggests that both favor and disgrace force individuals into misdirected identification: identification with self. By limiting external dependencies and moving toward
emotional independence, individuals reach a state where the intuition becomes finely
tuned and the instincts can be trusted. This state inspires self-love and self-understanding. lndividuals who master themselves become less egocentric, and their
sense of identity begins to reach out into the world around them. Once they have
attained this expanded awareness, they face a choice: They can identify with the
world and its "favors and disgraces," and become committed to working in it; or
they can love and accept it in all of its many forms. Evolved Individuals who love
with compassion have the capacity to guide the world and direct its future.

This is called the Essence of Tao.

In this passage,

one of the most mysterious in the Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu hints at
the nature of the Tao by describing what it is not. Awareness of the Tao cannot be
reached through the senses: it cannot be seen, heard, or felt. It resides in the realm
of the intuitive mind and can only be perceived through its effect in the environment:
its effect on ideas, events, and social transformations. Worldly events occur in everrepeating cycles, and those who follow the Tao learn to employ these cycles. They
"hold on to the ancient Tao" by tracing events back to their very beginnings. At the
same time, they trace back to the origins of their own existence in order to tap into
the intuitive mind. With an intuitive understanding of the patterns in life, the outcome of events can be apprehended and reality can be altered. The Essence of the
Tao is that an observer can evolve the observed through the act of tactical
observation.

Those who maintain the Tao
Do not desire to become full.
Indeed, since they are not full,
They can be used up and also renewed.
In this passage, Lao Tzu refers to reality as "muddy water," and suggests that in
order to gain an insight into its unfolding pattern, one must be able to harmonize
with its implicit unity and simplicity. Moreover, in order to use those insights to
guide reality, one must move with a stability that causes no outside resistance.
Evolved Individuals know that the less obvious they make their advantage, the more
effective their power becomes. Thus, when using their power, Evolved Individuals
are hesitant and reserved. They spend their power to bring clarity and cooperation
into their world. They are candid, open, and integrated in their environment, and
they serve as conduits, not as accumulators, for energy and matter. In this way,
Evolved Individuals are ever replenished with the new and the vital as they continue
to develop insight and power.

This passage is an awareness exercise wherein the mind is fully expanded and
placed in intimate identification with the universe and its reach for conciousness.
Worldly expectations, desires, and fixations slip away and are replaced by receptivity, openness, and integration. In this way, those who follow the Tao touch the
mind of the universe with their own. Thus they are able to apprehend the physical
rhythms and cycles of the universe as they are reflected in the ways of society; they
are able to predict the resolution of events and step out of the way of danger.

LIFE FORCE
In the character life force ( 555 ) the symbols for purity and growth are combined to
suggest vigor and refinement. The first symbol ( if: )shaws rice grains ( :1 ) that
have been thrashed and separated ( 1' ), thus purified. It is combined with the
symbol for life, the color green ( if ), which is composed of two parts. The first is

the pictogramfor a living plant ( :‘E ) sprouting from the earth, and the other is the
alchemist’s stove():1 ) used to refine and distill matter to its essence.

Tao is an informed force. It brings Power to individuals who are aware of it because
the collective-unconscious urges and social trends of a culture parallel exactly the
physical laws that operate through the Tao. Philosophically, this is one of the most
important passages in the Tao Te Ching. It suggests that the origins of the Tao can
be sensed through an intuitive experience, a thought experiment, of the very beginnings of all reality (the Collective Origin). Evolved Individuals contemplate the intera state similar to the one that

preceded the Big Bang. Then they reach farther back and identify with the Absolute

Lao Tzu realized that many of the physical laws in nature are reflected in the affairs
of society. He saw a pattern of change that was independent of the movements of
the solar system; not governed by the passage of time, but instead governed by
cause and effect. The Taoist goal is to control cause and effect by transcending it
through balance and harmony with the environment. Evolved Individuals regard an
obvious and aggressive attempt to gain power and position as a dangerous cause that
may result in an uncontrolled effect. They achieve their aims by consolidating their

steady, harmonious transfonnation. Those who follow the Tao know that heated
confrontations do not yield long-term results. Only attitudes that can be sustained
will have the power to alter reality.
The Power discussed in this passage and throughout the Tao Te Ching is power
over one's continuing reality. Personal power brings independence and freedom into
the life of the individual, and it is continuously cultivated through attitude and
projection. What one believes, one becomes. The more of a "mind" one has to

There was something in a state of fusion
Before Heaven and Earth were born.

Silent, vast,
Independent, and unchanging;
Working everywhere, tirelessly;
It can be regarded
I do not know its name;

as

Mother of the world.

The word I say is Tao.
Forced to give it a name,
I say Great.

means continuing.
Continuing means going far.
Going far means returning.

Therefore the Tao is Great.
Heaven and Earth are Great.
A leader is likewise Great.
In the universe there are four Greatnesses,
And leadership is one of them.
Humans

are modeled on the earth.
The earth is modeled on heaven.
Heaven is modeled on the Tao.
The Tao is modeled on nature.

The first

lines in this passage describe the Taoist view of the period shortly after
when the Tao came into existence but all matter and
energy remained one cohesive and undifferentiated substance. Theoretical physicists, searching for a single interaction, or unified field, at the heart of the universe,
might describe this state as one that existed seconds before the Big Bang. In the first
billionth of a second after the beginning of the Big Bang, the four forces appeared
(gravity, strong nuclear force, electromagnetism, and weak nuclear force), and
energy and matter, time and space, were differentiated. Lao Tzu calls the actions of
the physical forces throughout the universe and in the social patterns of human
beings, the Tao.
The term Great in this passage refers to the Tao and its cyclic movements through
or, given enough time, history repeats
reality. Because it goes far, it returns
itself. The movements of the Tao follow the laws of the physical forces, and the
Power (Te) of Taoism lies in perceiving and understanding the manifestations of
those laws in society. Evolved Leaders intuitively perceive the Tao in the evolution
of society, and thus they are able to guide those whom they lead to harmony and

boy would one day have the throne. He was thoroughly educated in the arts,
literature, horsemanship, archery, and the skills of military strategy and tactics.
In 1735. at the age of twenty-four, Ch'ien Lung was proclaimed emperor.

During the first ten years, his reign became a succession of internal wars, which
eventually calmed. For the nextfifty years the empire enjoyed peace and prosperity
while the population nearly doubled to 200 million. Ch'ien Lung concentrated on
China's cultural development. He ordered a search for all literary works worthy of
preservation and commissioned a descriptive catalogue of the Imperial Library,
which included not only the history of each work, but also a detailed
academic critique of it. After sixty successful years ofpower, Ch 'ien Lung
abdicated in favor of his son.

It is the responsibility of Evolved Leaders

to create a

calm

center that will serve as

the foundation for their organizations. Regardless of the stimulating diversions in
their path, they must retain their composure and sense of purpose. They do not let
themselves become separated from their "baggage," and thus they maintain their
position through seriousmtindedness. The concept of "ten thousand chariots" was
an unimaginably formidable power to the ancient Chinese, perhaps something on the
scale of nuclear power today. Lao Tzu believed that leaders with such power have
an awesome responsibility and can be neither light-hearted nor agitated.

And an inferior person is the resource of a good person.
One who does not treasure a teacher, or does not cherish a resource,
Although intelligent, is greatly deluded.
This is called

Significant Subtlety.

When individuals

use force and manipulative methods to shape events, they are
walking a path that is already rutted, using logic that is inherently flawed, and basing

their calculations on schemes and guesses. Just as the most skillful knots and locks
hold things in place without excessive force, certain ends are best accomplished
without the use of obvious means. In worldly undertakings, the most effective and
far-reaching systems rely upon spontaneity, creativity, and an intuitive understanding of human nature and social needs.
Evolved Individuals skillfully employ people and things, and thus spread the
Light: the information that helps steer the course of evolution. In this way, the skillful person becomes a teacher. Herein lies the symbiotic relationship that reflects the
interdependence between all states in the universe: energy and matter, proton and
electron, time and space. Inferior (or uninformed) individuals require for their fulfillment and growth a model after which they can pattern themselves. Teachers
derive energy and penetrating insight from acting as that model. Thus, with the proper values and attitudes toward each other, they are both transformed and come into

harmony and

accord with the Tao.

The word schemes, sometimes translated as "counting chips" or
"tallies," is actually derived from the name of a bamboo device used
in divination. In modern usage, this phrase might be translated as

"pl ans or stratagems."

talents of otherwise unconnected individuals into a collective endeavor. Just as reservoirs collect water, leaders become low spots for the exchange of power and information. They are aware of the instability in aggression and obviousness. To hold
their position they are receptive, subtle, and modest.
In physics, the four forces in the universe are those forces engaged in holding
matter together (gravity, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, and electromagnetism). In the Taoist view, leaders who imitate those forces by connecting individuals and evolving society are given the Power to alter reality. In this passage, Lao
Tzu uses the images of Infancy, Limitlessness, and Simplicity to describe the intuitive understanding of the Great System: the united field of matter and energy as it
prior to the beginnings of the known universe. To know this is to perceive

EMPEROR YAO
The Emperor Yao (died 2258 B.C.) is one of China’s great legendary emperors. He
ascended the throne in 2357 BC. and toured his domain from time to time to inspect
its condition. His reign is known as one of contentment and social stability. At his
retirement, he chose to bypass his worthless son Tan Chu and abdicate his throne in
favor of a gifted farmer named Shun, thereby setting the precedent of handing down
the throne to the worthy and deserving.

Emperor Yao understood clearly the importance ofleadership and believed that
strong social order was based on universal patterns, which he did his best to record.
He kept a record of astronomical observations
the cycles of the moon and
planetary revolutions —and compiled a calendar consisting of 3 60 days andfour
seasons. Thus he is credited with teaching his people to
regulate agriculture by

The world is a mysterious instrument,
Not: made to be handled.

Those who act on it, spoil it.
Those who seize it, lose it.

So, in Natural Law
Some lead, some follow;
Some agitate, some remain silent;
Some are firm, some are weak;
Some carry on, some lose heart.

Thus, Evolved Individuals
Avoid extremes,
Avoid extravagance,
Avoid excess.

All systems have hidden within them a natural geometry. Crystals form and cells
replicate within a strict mathematical organization. Thus, to interfere with the natural
state of people or events is a futile and often tragic endeavor. In social systems,
Evolved Individuals observe and understand this natural state and then position
themselves appropriately. They are always in harmony with the deeper trends in the
evolution of society. They exert the force of their convictions through a state of
focused inner awareness, while externally they practice strategic noninterference.
Those who follow the Tao are reluctant to push things to the extreme, even to extremes of complacency, for they know that this can lead to undesirable counterreactions. Instead they strive to maintain their intellectual balance by experiencing the
rhythms of natural events with emotional independence.

Therefore those who advise leaders are responsible for holding the organization back
from the excess that leads to collapse. Those who design forceful strategies to use
against other organizations are not fit to advise leaders, because the nature of their
work
as necessary as it may be
limits their intellectual capacity to apprehend
the evolution of society (the Tao). Evolved Individuals know that it is possible to
achieve success without planting the seeds of self-destruction. Therefore they are
not aggressive and they are not acquisitive. Only individuals with such characteristics are fit to guide the leader of an organization.

When the use of force is unavoidable, Evolved leaders practice restraint. Furthermore, they know that force will enhance personal power only to the extent that
it is regrettable. Once victory is achieved, they do not allow themselves to feel joy;
instead, they express regret. Their attitude strongly affects their organization, and

thus internal conflicts are regarded as a matter of sorrow as well. Therefore a regretful attitude in leaders during times of external force can have a calming and peaceful
effect on the internal affairs of the organization.

—-

leaders to learn when to stop and practice noninterference. Leaders who insist on
exacting systems and roles in their organizations cannot create a natural, effortless
atmosphere for the completion of tasks, because the structure they conceive of is
suited for machines, not humans. When people are forced into roles and every
aspect of their work defined, their possibilities become limited, they no longer
create, and they do not evolve. When leaders systematize every detail in their
organization, they close it off from the possibility of evolution. Just as life forms
that are highly specialized move in the direction of extinction, this path leads to the
extinction of the organization. On the other hand, with open-ended management the
people have nothing to resist or resent. They become spontaneously cooperative
because their attention shifts to the end rather than the means.

Self-knowledge and self-mastery are the primary Taoist accomplishments. They are
achieved when individuals cultivate the inner mind, refining their instincts and
intuitive responses to the world. The result is insight: the ability to perceive the
larger influences behind specific social phenomena. To know the inner mind and
perceive its connection with the evolving mind of the universe is the foundation for
foresight and lasting influence. Through inner knowledge, one develops the ability
to alter the world through small, effortless actions at the very
beginning of events. It
is essential to discriminate between clever force and insightful strength, for only the
latter will not meet with resistance or cause counter-reactions. Those who "die and
yet do not perish," are those who leave the affairs of the world in a more evolved
state than they found them.

GREAT IMAGE
The concept of great ( ii ) is symbolized by a human form with the arms stretched
out to their limit. This character is combined with the ideogram for image ( 31), a
modification of a primitive drawing of an elephant ( $2 ) showing the trunk ( f" ),
tusks ( ’7 ), and body with legs and tail ( 9} ). An elephant is the symbol for image
due, in part, to its large size and memorable shape.

EMPEROR T'AI TSU OF THE SUNG DYNASTY
Chao K 'uang-yin, known as the Emperor T’ai Tsu, founded the Sung Dynasty and
ruled China from AD. 960 to 976. Descended from a long line ofofl'icials, T’ai Tsu
rose to high military command. Because of his reputation for using authority fairly,
his men looked to him for guidance during the disturbed state of the new empire.
To reunify the war-torn nation, he placed the military under strong control and used
diplomatic processes instead. He selected his ofl‘icialsfrom the ranks of the learned,
and impressed on his military officers the need for study.
T'ai Tsu made his magistrates directly responsible to him, and during battle
he commanded that there be no wholesale slaughter or looting ofproperty. Emperor
T'ai Tsu was frugal by nature and he forbade excessive luxury in his government,
declaring that the empire was a great trust that he held. As a result, the
contemplation of nature's beauty became the major theme in the art throughout
the Sung Dynasty. Afterfifteen years ofbeneficial rule, he abdicated in
favor of his brother, T’ai Tsung.

CONCEALING THE ADVANTAGE
In order to

deplete it,

It must be thoroughly extended.
In order to weaken it,
It must be thoroughly strengthened.
In order to reject it,

In order to take away from it,

Subtle

Insight.

The yielding can triumph over the inflexible;
The weak can triumph over the strong.
Fish should not be taken from deep waters;
Nor should organizations make obvious their advantages.

Organizations with the highest strategic advantage are those with the greatest poten-

tial for loss. When an organization becomes overextended, when it complacently
accepts praise and promotion, gifts and abundant profits, when it believes itself to be
it is then that it is most vulnerable. It has become unstable
growing ever stronger
within the natural cycle of polarity and is on a path leading toward its opposite state.
Because "fish" taken from the watery depths cannot survive, organizations should
keep their advantages out of sight and out of action. Advantages that are restrained
are more effective and long-lasting titan those that are displayed because concealed
advantages do not cause resistance or counter-reactions.
Inherent in this passage are instructions for a smaller organization that would
overcome a larger one. The principle behind "Subtle Insight" is one that is frequently
repeated in the Tao Te Ching: The weak can overcome the strong by yielding and
contributing to the excessiveness of the strong. Excessiveness germinates the seed
that forces things to grow into their opposite.

LEADER
In its most originalform, the character for leader (3.) was a pictogram of three jade
beads ( E ) threaded together ( i ). Since only a wealthy and powerful individual
could afl'ord to possess such stones, the pictogram became synonymous with the
word for ruler. More recent descriptions state that the character depicts an upright
individual ( I ) vested with the power to unite the planes of heaven (
),

), and humanity (

naturally stabilized.

Lao Tzu believed that the best leaders

were

those with the intellectual and emotional

strength to guide rather than rule. Evolved Leaders put all of their energies into
leading the way, and they do not interfere with the lives of their followers. Thus
people are influenced naturally, without resistance, resentment, or reaction. When
people do not follow, it is because the leader is moving against the grain of human
nature and against the direction of social evolution. Such leaders bring chaos to the
world.
Leaders who hold to the Tao when guiding others are ever active in their own
internal growth. In order to align themselves with the trends in society and the
movements in nature (the Tao), they practice simplicity in their lives and work. In
this way, they avoid the distorted intellectual and emotional growth that comes with
any fixation on material possessions or self-aggrandizing social systems. Because
they free themselves from irrelevant and misleading desires, they receive insights
that bring harmony and stability to everything they touch.

POWER WITHOUT MOTIVE
Superior Power is

never Powerful, thus it has Power.
Inferior Power is always Powerful, thus it has no Power.
Superior Power takes no action and acts without motive.
Inferior Power takes action and acts with motive.

Superior philanthropy takes action and acts without motive.
Superior morality takes action and acts with motive.
Superior propriety takes action and there is no response;
So it raises its arm to project itself.
Therefore, lose the Tao and Power follows.
Lose the Power and philanthropy follows.
Lose philanthropy and morality follows.
Lose morality and propriety follows.
One who has propriety has the veneer of truth
And yet is the leader of confusion.
One who knows the future has the luster of the Tao
And yet is ignorant of its origins.

Therefore those with the greatest endurance
Can enter the substantial,
Not occupy its veneer;
Can enter reality,
Not occupy its luster.
Hence they discard one and receive the other.
Evolved Power is irresistible because it is based on substance and reality and is free
of motive. Power that has degenerated into force involves complex strategies and
social manipulations because it is based on appearance and illusion. Lao Tzu believed that morality was an invention of leaders who could not find truth in themselves and thus were unable to trust others to conduct themselves appropriately. But
even more dangerous to the independent-minded Lao Tzu was propriety
conduct
that requires study, memory, and occasional hypocrisy to follow. He believed that
propriety would contaminate with motive the inherently good and truthful instincts
of humans.
—

The word propriety (It) refers to the ceremonies, rituals, and social
forms of a culture. Li expresses the current standards of social
behavior.

that governs cause and effect. In social realms this manifests in such cycles as easy
and difficult or active and passive. The law of polarity changes and evolves all
things by acting upon extremes. Extremes are overcharged and begin moving in their
opposite direction. Those who follow the Tao avoid extremes and practice moderand receptivity. In this way they gain power by moving with the prevailing

The word polarity is variously translated as "reverse," "return," or
"repeat." It is used in the Tao Te Ching to describe a key physical
law at work in the universe.

MASTERING THE PARADOX
When

superior leaders hear of the Tao,
They diligently try to practice it.
When average leaders hear of the Tao,
They appear both aware and unaware of it.
When infen'or leaders hear of the Tao,
They roar with laughter.
Without sufficient laughter, it could not be the Tao;
Hence the long—established sayings:
The Tao illuminated appears to be obscure;
The Tao advancing appears to be retreating;
The Tao leveled appears to be uneven.

Superior Power appears to be low;
Great clarity appears to be spotted;
Extensive Power appears to be insufficient;
Established Power appears to be stolen;
Substantial Power appears to be spurious.
The greatest space has no corners;
The greatest talents are slowly-mastered;
The greatest music has the rarest sound;
The Great Image has no form.
The Tao is hidden and nameless,
Yet it is the Tao that skillfully supports and

completes.

Those who follow the Tao continually look beyond the present reality in

an

attempt

perceive the seeds of change. They have complete faith in physical laws that demonstrate that all of reality is in a process of change and all processes cycle in the
direction of their opposite
life to death, positive to negative, energy to matter
and back again. Because they learn to recognize and understand the law of polarity,
they gain extraordinary insight into worldly affairs.
Evolved Individuals know that people who are not intuitive can be dangerous to
work with since they are guided solely by the current appearance of things that are,
in reality, changing. Unintuitive actions and decisions lack dimension, and, what is
worse, they may interfere insensitively with the natural process of change and cause
dangerous counter-reactions. Evolved Individuals seek out others who have intuition
and vision
a form of intelligence that comes from cultivating the instincts, observing the direction of change, and apprehending the evolution of ideas.

The Tao produced the One.
The One produced the Two.
The Two produced the Three.
The Three produced All Things.

All Things carry Yin and hold to Yang;
Their blended Influence brings Harmony.

People hate to be alone, lonely, and unfavored;
And yet leaders take these names.
Thus in Natural Law
Some lose and in this way profit.
Some profit and in this way lose.

What others have taught, I also teach:
Those who are violent do not die naturally.
I will make this my chief teaching.

This is the

of the universe. What he does not touch on, in this passage, is the Absolute that

produced the Tao. The Absolute stands outside of space and time
universes it creates. The Tao produced the One: temporal/spatial reality. The One
produced the Two: the opposite charges of positive and negative (yin and yang).
The Two produced the Three: matter, energy, and the physical laws that bind them
together. From these three came the existence of All Things in the universe. All
Things are interconnected and interdependent, and from this concept comes the
behavior of polarity: When something increases, something else decreases. Thus
Evolved Leaders who wish to endure do not elevate themselves; and those who
would like to live out their days are never violent.

moving matter from place to place and reproducing life forms that may ultimately
have the potential for intellectual evolution. Materially oriented individuals cannot
evolve intellectually because their attachment to and hoarding of matter trains the
mind to view reality as fixed and unflowing. This view is in harmony with dying,
not growth, and thus they cannot connect with the larger meaning behind
conciousness.
Those who follow the Tao realize that they are in a more powerful position
when they are mobile, unburdened, and independent. For the Taoist, excessive
possessions are treated like ballast. They are released to gain greater buoyancy. Just
as air rushes in to fill a vacuum, more things will come into and pass through such

Hsieh An

(A.D. 320-385) was a member of a very distinguished and politically
prominent family, although in the early part of his life he preferred to live in
retirement, engaged in scholarly pursuits. It was only when his brother, a military
commander, got into difiiculties that Hsieh An entered official life and rapidly
ascended to a post of importance and power. Nevertheless, his preference for
contemplation and cultured leisure earned him the title "Refined Minister."
Under his direction, his brother and his nephew set of to halt a nearing invasion.
The result of the conflict was anxiously awaited by all, yet Hsieh An had
such composure that he passed the time with wei ch‘i, a game requiring great
concentration and skill. When a courier arrived from the front to say that the
enemy had been routed, he read it calmly and, upon being asked by a guest what
the news was, he replied: "Merely that my boys have defeated the rebels,"
and proceeded to finish his game.

The most valuable knowledge one can acquire comes through the cultivation of intu-

ition and the practice of noninterference. This knowledge addresses a deeper level of
awareness than that gained through action, for knowledge that comes through action
is obscured by situation-specific reactions. Those who follow the Tao use strategic
noninterference to lead them to exceptional awareness. In this way Evolved Individuals can align themselves so that their inner world reflects the world around
them. They are using tactical inenness to ensure that their current instincts and
impressions are in harmony with the larger forces at work in the world. With this
knowledge they can position themselves appropriately and effectively in order to
achieve their aims.

Through nonaction nothing is left undone.
The world is always held without effort.
The moment there is effort,

a thought experiment that explores the practice of calculated nonaction as the means to gain powerful insights into worldly affairs. Those who follow
the Tao are ooncemed with removing fixed ideas from the mind in order to clear the
way for impressions based on the transformation and evolution of their environment. Static information limits the mind's ability to "read" impressions that are
coming into it in the language of possibility and change. Lao Tzu believed that using
action or effort to elicit information would yield a contaminated form of reality
one based on the world's reactions to one's actions. The Taoist ideal is to gain pure
information by observing a world that is not reacting to one's interference. Evolved
Individuals use pure information to refine their intuitive and instinctive knowledge.

The Evolved Individuals in the world
Attract the world and merge with its mind.
The People all focus their eyes and ears;
Evolved Individuals all act as infants.

Evolved Individuals keep their minds open and impartial because fixed opinions or
belief systems distort the flow of pure information coming in from the outside
world. They enhance their understanding of the world and their position in it by
merging with the collective mind of world society. They do not rely solely on information gained through their eyes and ears, but look beyond with an open heart and
mind. In this way, infantlike, they can act upon the world without unbalancing it.
By trusting those who cannot find trust in themselves and showing goodness to
those who are not good people, Evolved Individuals are emulating the Tao. They are
using an opposite force to neutralize an extreme, thus altering the internal reality of
untrusting, mean people. This response runs contrary to the common one where aggression is met with aggression, hate with hate, and anger with anger. In observing
the laws of nature, however, Evolved Individuals realize that an acid is not neutralized by adding more acid. It is neutralized by infusing it with its opposite: an alkaline solution. Lao Tzu believed that the ability to neutralize extremes and alter reality
is the ultimate Power that will bring peace to the world.
In this passage, the word People can be literally translated as "the
hundred families." This term refers to all of the family names in
China and represents the entire population.

invulnerabilities in life. Lao Tzu believed that individuals are protected from harm,
not because they are lucky, but because they do not cultivate weaknesses (the realm
of death). Therefore, Evolved Individuals do not put themselves into positions
where they are vulnerable to attack or misfortune. They are aware that as life goes

term Mother is another expression used in the Tao Te Ching to describe the
Tao. Her offspring are the "ten thousand things": All Things in the universe. Here it
is suggested that by observing the physical laws that govern the behavior of matter,
one can begin to perceive the Tao. When one knows the Tao, life holds less fear, for
the mind expands and becomes familiar with the unknown.
In this passage, two approaches to the outside world are described. In one, individuals close down their senses and cut off extemal input; in the other, individuals
open wide all their senses and lose themselves in worldly endeavors. Both approaches have less-than-fortunate results: one lacks meaningful undertakings, the
other is hopelessly entangled. Instead Lao Tzu presents a strategy to lend stability to
worldly perceptions and avert difficulties. By continually augmenting one's external
view of the the world with information from the intuitive mind, one develops a sense
of the continuous processes and patterns in life. This cultivation of instinct and
intuition is indispensable to the development of an evolved mind.

THE EMPEROR T'AI TSUNG
The

Emperor T'ai Tsung (AD. 597-649), whose personal name was Li Shih-min,
the second son of the Emperor Kao Tsu, founder of the Tang Dynasty.
He helped his father topple the dying Sui Dynasty, whose grandiose ambition to
militarily unify China and construct a superior canal system had taxed the people into
poverty. When his father took the reins of the empire, T’ai Tsung took an active part
in social reforms. T'ai Tsungfostered education and restored astronomy to a
practical, rather than metaphysical, science. Upon his father's retirement he
embarked on a reign of unparalleled brilliance.
was

Emperor T’ai Tsung learned from the lesson of the corrupt Sui Dynasty. He gave
power to educated civil servants rather than aristocrats or military ofi'icers, and
encouraged his courtiers to express themselves freely. He frequently summoned
local ofl‘icials to inquire into the well-being of his subjects and continuously
reviewed the policies of his government. In later years he wrote the book A Guide
for Emperors to pass on to his descendants; and among his recorded sayings, the
best known is: "By using a mirror of brass, you may see to adjust your cap; by
using antiquity as a mirror, you may learn to foresee the rise andfall of empires.

the Tao
requires no special knowledge or learning;
it is merely listening to the inner voice, taking note of the current social and environmental patterns, and holding to the path of least resistance. The path of least resistance is level and even, but for many the bypaths are tempting. The bypaths, in the
social realm, are excessive ambitions and desires that divide people from their inner
natures and from one another. When individuals indulge in extremes it serves only
to block their own personal development; but when organizations act this way, there
is danger to both the people whom they serve and to the organizations themselves.
A divided organization is one that is acting ambitiously or aggressively toward
its people or toward other organizations. These organizations economize where they
should spend (on nurturing and support) and spend where they should economize
(on appearances and weapons). Unbalanced organizations act against the laws of
nature, and thus they cannot remain long on earth.

This passage describes

a global perspective used to gain insight into the interdependent relationship between the individual and the outside world. Beginning with
the smallest social unit, the self, and then continuing on to the family, the community, its governing body, and world society, wherever Taoist principles are applied,
intelligent energy is enhanced. But in order to align those social units to the Tao,
their underlying patterns must be perceived by constructing in the mind a vision of
an ideally operating social unit: one that functions in a noncontentious, appropriately
supportive, and socially aesthetic manner. In order to conceive of an ideally functioning world, Evolved Individuals cultivate the inner mind. The power of a world
vision in an evolved mind can help draw that ideal into reality for future generations.

The infant is a frequent metaphor in the Tao Te Ching. To be infantlike is to be in
touch both with one's original nature and the current reality in the environment.

Infants act and react appropriately and spontaneously and do not attack or contend;
thus they are protected. Evolved Individuals, therefore, use spontaneity and noncontention as a spiritual martial art to transcend social dangers. When they are
pushed, they yield, and the pushers are thrown off balance by their own inappropriate efforts. Evolved Individuals focus solely on maintaining their stability and
a position that yields power. The physical laws of the universe reflect the
balance
fact that unbalanced energies are not stable and their time as such quickly passes.

Look to refined tranquillity,
And people will be naturally correct.

In this passage Lao Tzu suggests that leaders might unite the world if they could
lead without interference and govern without restrictive social structures. Too many
controls and regulations are a form of aggression against the natural processes of
refinement in people. In the Taoist view, the instincts of humans are fair and correct
and become aggressive and cunning only in reaction to excessive force from restrictive laws and imposed morality. Leaders who rise up and attempt to repress or manipulate others
collectively or individually
ultimately achieve the opposite of
aims. Such force defeats itself and in the process leads the organization into

Evolved Leaders reverse this process. They do not interfere when they can
avoid it; they are a model of intelligent calm within the organization; they undertake
endeavors where they are easy and nonconfrontive; and they subdue in their hearts
ostentatious ambitions and irrelevant desires. As a result, the people are favorably
influenced; they conduct themselves appropriately; they naturally prosper; and they
do not indulge in complex strategies and intrigues. In this way they naturally unite.

and discontent begin to grow within the organization. As the administration pushes,
the resistance of the people grows even stronger. Evolved Leaders understand the
action of polarity in nature, and therefore they avoid Such extremes. They know that
misfortune and good fortune do not respond to direct control, and that excessive
regulations toward "good" and "order" will surely cause a counter-reaction. Instead
they use their intelligence to shape the world without direct confrontation or excessive strategy or control. Stable, subtle, and sincere, they cultivate themselves and

THE WAY OF MODERATION
In

leading people and serving Nature,
There is nothing better than moderation.
Since, indeed, moderation means yielding early;
Yielding early means accumulating Power.

When Power is accumulated,
Nothing is impossible.
When nothing is impossible,
One knows no limits.
One who knows no limits
Can possess the organization.
An

organization that possesses the Mother

Can endure and advance.
This means deep roots and firm foundation:
Durability and longevity through observation of the Tao.
The responsibility of Evolved Leaders is to guide their subjects effectively while
remaining centered and self-aware; this is what is meant by "serving Nature." To
achieve moderation, leaders scrupulously avoid extremes and adopt nonconfrontive
postures. With moderation comes endurance, personal power, and unlimited possibilities. Centered leaders tend to experience an ever-expanding influence. When
Evolved Leaders, in turn, structure their organization in accord with the moderate,
centered path of the Tao, it will not be eroded by the turbulence of the extremes and
will therefore enjoy a long and prosperous existence.

The term Mother refers to the Tao. It is used as a metaphor since
the Tao, like the Mother, is the originator of all events.

EMPEROR KAO TSU OF THE T'ANG DYNASTY
The Emperor Kao Tsu, whose given name was Li Yuan (AD. 565 -635), was a
commandant at the end of the corrupt Sui Dynasty. The Sui Dynasty had exacted a
great toll on the Chinese people in the form of high taxes andforced labor, and its
unpopularity weakened its stability. With the aid of his son, Kao Tsu set up a
puppet king for the two years of dynastic upheaval that followed the popular revolt.
Then Kao Tsu himself took the reins ofpower and ushered in China's golden era,
the Tang Dynasty.
As founder of the Tang Dynasty, the Emperor Koo Tsu ruled from 618 to 626.
He brought about reforms to expose and neutralize the political corruption of the
Sui. He redistributed the land holdings among the Chinese people and instituted an
"in-kind” system of taxation, whereby peasants could pay in goods or foods,
thus weakening the powers of the moneyed classes. Under his leadership,
China was pacified and united. After nine years he abdicated in favor of his son
and took the title of Emperor Emeritus.

The Evolved also do not harm others.

Not

In order

to support the organization in an uncertain atmosphere, a leader must
emulate the Tao by "cooking a small fish" appropriately. Just as too much stirring
will cause a delicate fish to fall apart, too much interference during a difficult period
will unbalance the situation and one's place within it. When there are no elegant,
effortless solutions, the appropriate stance is to allow the natural forces, the Tao, to
evolve problems and point the way toward their resolution. Therefore, the first
concern of Evolved Leaders is to cultivate the Tao in organizational affairs. Once the
Tao is enlisted
through sensitive, observant noninterference
many things will
become clear to everyone involved. Those who would plan Cunning strategies for
personal gain become obvious and thus ineffective. Once the organization needs no
longer to fear internal manipulation, productivity will prevail.

The term cunning comes from the Chinese word kuei. It may also
be translated as "spirit," ghost," or "demon." Kuei, as spirits, are
considered more mischievous and crafty than they are sinister or
evil.

THE POWER IN MODESTY
A large organization should flow downward
To intersect with the world.
It is the female of the world.
The female always overcomes the male by stillness;

Through stillness,

she makes herself low.

Thus if a large organization
Is lower than a small organization,
It can receive the small organization.
And if a small organization
Stays lower than a large organization,
It can receive the large organization.
Therefore one receives by becoming low;
Another receives by being low.
Yet what

a large organization desires
Is to unite and support others.
And what a small organization desires
Is to join and serve others.

So for both to gain the position they desire,
The larger should place itself low.
A nonaggressive, noninterfering stance is the natural diplomatic position for a large,
powerful organization to take toward a smaller one. This yielding position gives the
impression of submission, but has the advantage of generosity. When this position
is held, the small organization will not resent the power and position of the larger
and the large, by not aggressively promoting its own interests, will
organization
attract trust and cooperation from the smaller. Such positioning on the part of the
larger organization addresses the psychological needs of both, since large organizations benefit by uniting and supporting others, and small organizations benefit by
serving a larger audience. The power that comes from serving others occurs in all
from the interpersonal to the international. The Chinese

THE TAO IN LEADERS
The Tao is a refuge for All Things,
The treasure of the good,
The protector of the not good.
Honor can be bought with fine words;
Others can be joined with fine conduct.
So if some are not good,
Why waste them?
In this way the Emperor is established;
The three officials are installed.

And

although the large jade disc
Is preceded by a team of horses,
This is not as good as sitting,
Advancing in the Tao.
Why did those of old
Did they not say:

treasure the Tao?

Seek it and it is attained;
Possess faults and

they are released?

Thus it is the treasure of the world.

In organizations, the leader's role is

to help all members find their place and direct
them together into progress and fulfillment. Even though some people may be
insufficient or unrefined, Lao Tzu asks, "Why waste them?" An Evolved Leader is
certain to provide for the necessary education of everyone in the organization. In
this way all members become integrated in the organization and the leader's position
is established. To maintain that position, Evolved Leaders do not put emphasis on
the material advantages and the grand appearances of leadership, for these will only
serve to separate the world of the leader from the world of the people. The people's
needs cannot be met by such a leader. Instead Evolved Leaders look within to sense
the direction of social evolution (the Tao). In this way, they guide the people on the
appropriate path and they make no mistakes.

KING YU OF THE HSIA DYNASTY

During the reign of the legendary Emperor Yao, from 2357 to 2205 B.C., China was
plagued by devastating seasonalfloods. Emperor Yao enlisted Yu's father to
oversee the control of China's rivers by building a series of dikes. He failed afler
nine years of efi‘ort. The next Emperor, Shun, asked Yu to continue his father’s
work, and Yu took on the project, but with a dtferent approach. Instead of trying to
fight the rivers, he had them dredged and channeled so they could more easily reach
their goal. the sea, thereby bringing the floods under control.
To complete his work, Yu travelled throughout the countrysidefor thirteen years.
He was so intent on his mission that he passed his home three times but never
entered. He also made carefid studies of the people he came across in his travels and
established what their tribute to the court should be. As a rewardfor his
distinguished services, Emperor Shun abdicated in his favor. King Yu founded the
Hsia Dynasty and reigned from 2205 to 2197 B.C. To this day, King Yu's birthday,
which falls on June 6, is known as Engineer’s Day in China.

Act without

Taste without savoring.
Magnify the small; increase the few.

Repay ill-will

with kindness.

Plan the difficult when it is easy;
Handle the big where it is small.
The world's hardest work begins when it is easy;
The world's largest effort begins where it is small.
Evolved Individuals, finally, take no great action,
And in that way the great is achieved.
Those who commit easily, inspire little trust.
How easy to inspire hardness!
Therefore Evolved Individuals view all as difficult.
Finally they have no difficulty!

When Evolved Individuals must influence an ongoing process they will direct their
energy toward its weakest and most receptive area. Once their influence is absorbed,
they know that the weakness will move to another location. They follow. Never do
they find themselves in a direct confrontation with a formidable problem. Just as a
river finds its way through a valley of boulders, Evolved Individuals work their way
around areas of resistance, knowing that they will ultimately wear them down. Thus
an entire process can be influenced and controlled with small, nonconfrontive
actions. Because Evolved Individuals are serious minded, they inspire trust and
break down resistance; because they are subtle, their actions are appropriately
restrained and do not interfere with the natural cycle of events. In this way they
avoid counter-reactions and achieve their aims.

Thus Evolved Individuals desire to be desireless
And do not treasure goods that are hard to get.
They learn without learning,
By returning to the place where the Collective Mind passes.
In this way they assist All Things naturally
Without venturing to act.

This passage explores the control that

an individual might gain in worldly events
through the use of strategic noninterference. The underlying principle in this idea is
a very basic one in the physical sciences: Every action
produces a reaction; the more

forceful the action, the stronger the ultimate counter-force. Thus the results of forceful actions will either neutralize the individual doing the forcing, or they will hopelessly contaminate the situation being acted upon. For this reason, Evolved Individuals guide and control events by developing an instinct about where and when
events originate. They can then act when situations are in their smallest,
simplest,
most unentrenched, and least reactive state
and at the same time they can position
themselves to guide the situation through to completion. The instinct that signals the
origins of events can be cultivated in individuals who are not blinded by excessive
desires or crippled by dogmatic thinking. Individuals who are free of such limitations can use their intuitive powers to guide the world around them.

Leaders who impose elaborate strategies on people cause social reactions that
undermine the structure of the organization because clever strategies strike a resonant
chord in people and trigger their own cunning responses. If leaders, instead, guide
the organization with simplicity and directness, the inherent cleverness of the people
will be disanned. Simple and direct leadership is highly effective when it is intelligently aligned with the general trends in the environment. For that reason, it is
essential for leaders to examine both the current patterns in society and the constant
laws in nature.

PORTRAIT OF THE EMPEROR K'AN G HSI
The

Emperor K'ang Hsi (AD. 1655-1723) succeeded to the throne at the age of eight
and took up the reins of government at fifteen. His understanding and
compassionate policies endeared him to his people, and although he was personally
frugal, he lavished large sums on public works. He regularly toured the empire to
inquire into the welfare of his people; and during his sixty-one-year reign the empire
became so peaceful and prosperous that tax payments were cancelled several times.
K 'ang Hsi had a superior and inquiring mind, and his literary undertakings along
with his sense of the importance of recorded history made him one of China's
most illustrious leaders. He edited the vast Imperial Dictionary of over forty
thousand characters and ordered the compilation of the two extensive illustrated
encyclopedias of Chinese life and customs. Because he believed that cultural
information would help strengthen and protect the empire, the Emperor K 'ang Hsi
supervised the production ofa vast compendium of Chinese literature
containing over ten thousand volumes.

leader as well. When it is clear in their words and actions that leaders do not feel
superior to those whom they lead, the people see themselves in their leaders and
never tire of them.

THE POWER IN COMPASSION
All the world thinks that my Tao is great;
And yet it seems inconceivable.

Only its greatness makes it seem inconceivable.
If it could be conceived of,
It would have become insignificant

long

ago.

I have Three Treasures that support and protect:
The first is compassion.
The second is moderation.
The third is daring not to be first in the world.
With

compassion one becomes courageous;
With moderation one becomes expansive.
In daring not to be first in the world,
One becomes the instrument of leadership.
Now if one is courageous without compassion,
Or expansive without moderation,
Or first without holding back,
One is doomed!

Compassion always triumphs when attacked;
It brings security when maintained.
Nature aids its leaders
By arming them with
The Three Treasures

compassion.

compassion, moderation, and the courage not to be first in
the world
are the emotional foundations of Lao Tzu's method. Leaders whose
position will endure are those who are the most compassionate. Compassion is a
mysterious intellectual force that allows reality to act on the mind in a deeply
affecting way; and in turn the mind may act upon reality. Compassionate leaders are
able to make decisions with foresight and vision. Thus they triumph.
Lao Tzu opens this passage with a paradox
the idea that something can be so
large, so ever-present, and so profound that it becomes inconceivable. He suggests
that anything that can be fully conceived of and acted upon by the mind becomes
small and manageable. Yet true Power does not come from controlling the small and
manageable. Power comes from the mind-expanding exercise of conceiving of the
inconceivable.

LAO TZU
name Lao Tzu consists of the characters for old ( % ) and infant ( 53-). The
character for Lao shows a person ( )\) whose hair and beard ( i; ) have
changed ( L’. ). Tzu was originally drawn as a child with its amts and legs
outstretched ( )52 ) but was later modified to a swaddled child
lying on its side (£5« ).

The

low.

This is called the power in not contending.
This is called the strength to employ others.
This is called the highest emulation of Nature.
Lao Tzu believed that the

most capable and ultimately the most powerful leaders are
those who practice humility, subtlety, and composure. They are not aggressive and
do not feel the need to prove themselves again and again. The power in composure
and the strength in compassion will allow skillful leaders to organize others and
achieve a collective end without the oven use of means. Therefore events unfold
naturally, without disruptive counter-reactions.

Lao Tzu viewed the clash of ideologies as a fact of social evolution, but he observed, also, that some ideologies make inroads into the minds of people, while

disastrous counter-reactions. He realized that resistance to ideas can be
but only when indirect methods are employed will there be a lasting
effect. He called this "capturing without strategies." That is why his strategist would
rather "retreat a foot" than "advance an inch." Conversely, when an aggression is
used to impose an ideology on others, the reaction is also a direct one: Strategy is
met with strategy; weapon is matched against weapon; tensions escalate and escalate
again. Lao Tzu dreaded this familiar pattern and lamented, "Underestimating resistance will destroy my Treasures." He was referring to his Three Treasures:
compassion, moderation, and the courage not to be first in the world. How can
escalation be neutralized? Lao Tzu believed that the side that is so socially evolved
that it would experience gn'ef over the situation would be the side whose ideology
would ultimately triumph.

Lao Tzu's philosophy is remarkable in that it stubbornly resists logical analysis, yet

will readily submit to intuitive understanding. In this passage, he speaks directly to
the reader using the voice of the Tao. In early China, only the ruling class and their
scholars were able to read, so Lao Tzu was quite certain of his audience. He seems
to assume that his readers would not have the book in their hands had they not been
selected to influence the world. He hoped to instill in the minds of leaders an intuitive knowing that would allow them to peer into the future and perceive the evolution
of society. He believed this would give them the power to become more compassionately understanding of themselves and their people.
For the few who do understand his words, Lao Tzu passes on one of his most
important strategies for leaders. He suggests that they surround their advantages
with simplicity: "a coarse cloth covering." Those who follow the Tao introduce
simplicity into their lives by releasing themselves from the bondage of materialism
and the discipline of elaborate social strategies. They experience high levels of
personal freedom and intellectual independence and in this way they continually
renew their intuitive advantage: the "precious jade at the center."

The Empress Ma (AD. 1332-1382) and her husband, Emperor T'ai Tsu, were the
founders of the Ming Dynasty. Their phenomenal rise from paupers to founders of
a great empire has no parallel in Chinese history. The times were unique in that the
rise of the Ming Dynasty restored Chinese rule after a century ofMongol
domination. The Emperor T'ai Tsu had an intimate understanding of the needs
of the common people and concentrated more power than any other monarch in
Chinese history. He led the way to the restoration of Chinese culture and set about
rebuilding China's bridges, temples, gardens, and walled cities.
The Empress Ma had the reputation of a devoted wife and confidant to her husband.
She was considered wise, kind, and just; and perhaps in reaction to her background
as a commoner, she refused to have
any ofi‘icial titles awarded to her relatives,
exceptfor the title ofprince for her late father. Her concerns were for those around
her, and she constantly sought to moderate the Emperor’s passionate temper.
When the Emperor asked her last wishes on her deathbed, she is said to have
replied: 'That Your Majesty would strive for what is good, accept reproof,
and be as carefid at the end as at the beginning."

encouraged, in this passage, to minimize the distance between
position and the position of those whom they lead. In this
way the psychological needs of the people are better understood, and the decisions
of leaders are more aligned with those needs. Lao Tzu believed that the less people
fear or focus upon the embodiment of authority, the more effective authority becomes. In order to develop and preserve this appropriate attitude, leaders should
closely identify with those whom they lead. When they do not exhibit and enhance
their higher position, they will discover self-knowledge. Moreover, by discarding
any sense of self-importance they may have, they will find self-love and inner peace.

Lao Tzu believed that people are inherently good-hearted, and that to maintain this
state they require personal freedom, intellectual independence, and, most important,

life that is free of interference from above. When the organizational structures in
which people live and work become oppressive, then people will no longer fear
death as they reach for freedom.
The images of the Master Executioner and the Master Carpenter in this passage
refer to the laws in nature that override all temporary social systems. In the Taoist
is an unnatural act
within the law or outside of it
view, to kill a human being
that ultimately tears apart the fabric of society. Lao Tzu's analogy in this passage,
however, encompasses the damage that leaders will suffer when they exercise
authority that does not reside either in themselves or in the organization. Any laws,
restrictions, or punishments that inhibit the natural growth and independent development of the human mind will destroy both the organization and its leaders.

wrote the Tao Te Ching during an era when the separate states of China
vying with one another for political supremacy. In observing the rulers and the
lives of their subjects, he saw a pattern that he describes in this passage. Unevolved
leaders tend to develop a deep fear of losing their position, and they identify that fear
with the interests of the organization. As a result they take extraordinary defensive
measures to "protect" the organization, and they impose regulations that restrict the
livelihood of the people. The people, in paying for their leader’s fears, do not get
enough to eat. They become inured to the killing of other humans, and they develop
a growing contempt for their leader. Lao Tzu notes that organizations that interfere
with the instincts of the people and do not support their basic needs cannot endure
for long.

BAMBOO IN SNOW BY K'UO PI
In Chinese lore, bamboo is emblematic of longevity because of its great strength, its
usefulness, and its ability to flourish in winter. It is the most versatile of all plants
and is used in China forfood, paper, housing, and medicine. The thousand and one
uses of bamboo were enumerated in a third-century classic, the
Treatise on Bamboo (Chu P'u).
Bamboo has always been a favorite subjectfor calligraphers and painters, because
its elegant and responsive flexibility allows the artist to experiment with the effects
of invisible naturalforces, such as wind. The artist K’uo Pi (AD. 1301 to 1335)
was a gifted calligrapher who excelled in using brush and ink to depict bamboo.

Thus those who are firm and inflexible

The position of the yielding and receptive will ascend.
their observations of nature, those who follow the Tao know that what
survives on earth is that which easily adapts to the changing circumstances in the
environment. It is because the universe is evolving that all things in it are developing
and changing. Therefore any inflexibility in systems of belief, in patterns of behavior, or in habits of physical or intellectual nourishment, can cause one to respond to
external stimuli in a way that leads to extinction. Similar situations should not

necessarily elicit the same responses through time

Those who follow the Tao

are aware of nature's tendency to balance extremes in the
environment. In the ecological plane, nature is adept at pulling down species that
grow too dominant and carefully supporting those that are most fragile. On the
atomic level, this balancing can be observed in the way that over-charged particles
seek out their opposite to stabilize their existence. So too, on the social plateau,
individuals who attempt to dominate others trigger a natural psychological response
from their society: a collective urge to neutralize the effect of the excessive members.
The complement of this response, in group psychology, is the urge to direct help
toward individuals who have insufficient means.
Because Evolved Individuals understand this pattern of energy in the universe,
they are able to use it to protect their position while they bring progress to their
world. So that energy will flow in their direction, they reduce their position by
maintaining an atmosphere of moderation and humility in their relations to others.
They then use this energy to alter reality through the focus of their attitudes and
convictions.

a familiar image in the Tao Te Ching, that of the triumph of
the hard and inflexible. Water yields and receives, and because it has no
edge, no shape, no limits (what it is not), it can absorb and erode firmness and
structure. In accepting blame, Evolved Leaders willingly yield, taking on the soft,
receptive qualities of water that lead to ultimate triumph. They know that accepting
the responsibility for all problems within the organization will stabilize their position
and extend their influence. It is this paradox, perhaps, that prompted Lao Tzu to
note, "Right words appear to reverse themselves."

Two forms of blame are mentioned in this passage. One is the blame of disgrace: those mistakes made within the organization. Leaders who accept this responsibility are fit to guide the organization. The other blame is for misfortunes that befall
the organization from outside. Leaders who accept this responsibility believe that
they have the capacity to foresee and avert such problems. These leaders are fit to
guide the world.
The term grain shrine comes from ancient times when shrines
devoted to the fertility of the crops were constructed on the land by
its feudal lord. Frequently the shrine contained soil from the capital
of the kingdom.
